# A Mochi Clone
This is a diy project inspired by [https://dasai.com.au/products/mochi-3](Mochi) with custom animations and movements sensors. Project was created using an ESP32-S3 device with an OLED display and MP6050 gyroscope.

Animations are created by me using ProCreate Dreams, there are a total of 15 unique expressions for Mochi, 6-8 seconds each and will play randomly or through sensor movements.
